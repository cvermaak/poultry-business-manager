# House Preparation Best Practices Research

## Industry Standards (Cobb, Aviagen, etc.)

### Timeline Overview
- **Day -7 to -14**: Cleaning and disinfection (allow 7+ days downtime between flocks)
- **Day -5**: Water system flushing with high chlorine (140 ppm), then fresh water
- **Day -3 to -2**: Bedding placement, equipment setup
- **Day -1 (24 hours before)**: Pre-heating to 32-35°C (90-95°F)
- **Day 0**: Final checks, feed/water ready

### Equipment Checklist (Cobb Pre-Placement)
- Verify all heaters installed at recommended height, operating at maximum output
- With forced air heating: floor temp at least 32°C (90°F) with 30-50% relative humidity
- If radiant heaters/brooder stoves: 40.5°C (105°F) under heat source

### Drinkers
- 14-16 drinkers per 1,000 chicks in brooding area (8-10 can be bell drinkers)
- Nipple drinkers at chick eye level
- Flush water lines before placement

### Feeders
- Provide supplemental feeders for first 7-10 days (paper, trays, or lids)
- If using paper, feed area should cover at least 50% of brooding area
- Trays at rate of one tray per 50 chicks
- Place automatic feeders on floor for easy access

## User's Current Protocol (South Africa)
- Day -7: Sanitize house ✓ (aligns with industry 7-day downtime)
- Day -5: Flush header tank and water lines, replace mini floater ✓ (aligns with water system prep)
- Day -3: Prepare brooder area, fresh bedding, chick paper, empty fountains ✓ (aligns with equipment setup)
- Day -1: Pre-heat to 32-35°C ✓ (aligns with 24-hour pre-heat requirement)
- Day 0: Fill feed lines, stress-pack water, final inspection ✓ (aligns with placement day checks)

## Assessment: User's Protocol Aligns Well with Best Practices

### Recommendations for Enhanced Descriptions:
1. **Day -7**: Add specific disinfectant contact time and drying requirements
2. **Day -5**: Specify chlorine levels for flushing (140 ppm), then fresh water rinse
3. **Day -3**: Add coverage percentages for chick paper (50% of brooding area)
4. **Day -1**: Add humidity target (30-50%) alongside temperature
5. **Day 0**: Add crop fill check reminder (80% at 8 hours, 96% at 24 hours)

### Additional Best Practice Reminders to Consider:
- Biosecurity check (footbaths, visitor log) - Day -1 or Day 0
- Litter moisture check (20-25% ideal) - Day -1
- Ventilation minimum settings verification - Day -1
- Emergency equipment check (backup heaters, generators) - Day -2
